#Any-Rest

A very simple base app stack for setting up angular.js apps with a dynamic RESTful API into mongoDB. 

I found myself trying to define schemas in my applications as apposed to clearly defined server schemas, and realized that my server side code could be largely boilerplated to handle customisable RESTful APIs which can be locked down later to be more restrive.
